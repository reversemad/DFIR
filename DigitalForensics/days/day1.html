    Overview of Storage Categories and Mediums
  </h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    In forensic investigations, storage devices fall into three main categories—primary, secondary,
    and tertiary—based on how data persists and the role each plays. Beneath these categories are
    distinct technologies (magnetic, flash, optical, cloud) that dictate choice of tools and processes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Storage</strong>: Volatile memory like RAM and CPU cache. Holds running processes, encryption keys, and in-flight data that vanishes on power-off.</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary Storage</strong>: Non-volatile devices such as HDDs, SSDs, USB sticks, and memory cards. Retain files, deleted remnants, and filesystem metadata.</li>
    <li><strong>Tertiary Storage</strong>: Offline media like magnetic tapes and optical discs in jukeboxes. Used for long-term archives and backups.</li>
    <li><strong>Virtual & Cloud Storage</strong>: VM disks (VMDK/VHD) and object stores (AWS S3, Azure Blob). Persist across data centers with versioning and replication metadata.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="volatile-vs-non-volatile-memory">
    Volatile vs Non-Volatile Memory
  </h2>
  <p>
    Understanding volatility is essential to capture data before it’s lost.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Volatile Memory</strong>: DRAM (RAM) and CPU caches (L1/L2/L3) that lose contents when power is removed. Use live-capture tools like Belkasoft RAM Capturer or FTK Imager RAM.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Volatile Memory</strong>: Magnetic disks/tapes, NAND flash media, optical discs, and cloud object stores. Use bit-stream imaging, wear-leveling analysis, compression control, and API-driven exports.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="objectives">
  <h2 id="key-forensic-objectives-by-medium">
    Key Forensic Objectives by Medium
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Magnetic Media</strong>: Preserve exact bit copies; watch for host-protected areas and proprietary sector layouts.</li>
    <li><strong>Flash Media</strong>: Account for TRIM operations and over-provisioned regions; capture entire NAND image when possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Optical Media</strong>: Disable hardware compression and log every disc swap or library action.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Object Stores</strong>: Script API pulls to capture data plus full metadata; reconcile eventual consistency and audit logs.</li>
  </ul>

    Storage Types and Forensic Implications
  </h2>
  <p>
    Categories define <em>what</em> you’re dealing with; types define <em>how</em> you access it. Selecting 
    the wrong approach risks evidence gaps or contamination.
  </p>

  <h3 id="direct-attached-storage-das">Direct Attached Storage (DAS)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Locally connected block devices (SATA, NVMe, USB).</li>

          <li>Locally connected block devices (SATA, NVMe, USB).</li>
          <li>Use hardware write-blockers and bit-stream tools (`dd`, FTK Imager, Guymager).</li>
          <li>Beware BIOS/UEFI quirks that hide or remap NVMe partitions.</li>
          <li>SSDs demand TRIM-aware capture and may require vendor SDKs for forensic-grade dumps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Network Attached Storage (NAS)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>File-level shares via NFS, SMB/CIFS, or AFP.</li>
          <li>Leverage snapshots/exports to preserve ACLs, timestamps, and extended attributes.</li>
          <li>If mounting risks writes, capture packets (`tcpdump`, Wireshark) and reconstruct transfers offline.</li>
          <li>Document filesystem types (Btrfs, ZFS) and deduplication settings that affect deleted-data visibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Storage Area Network (SAN)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Block volumes over Fibre Channel or iSCSI.</li>
          <li>Map LUNs and zoning with administrators before imaging.</li>
          <li>Handle multipath carefully; use vendor utilities (EMC Navisphere, NetApp SnapManager).</li>
          <li>SAN taps can intercept FC frames or iSCSI commands when direct admin access is limited.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>RESTful APIs expose object and file stores.</li>
          <li>Use SDKs/CLI (`aws s3api`, `az storage blob`) to download data plus metadata.</li>
          <li>Track versioning, replication status, and correlate with audit logs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Archival & Tape Libraries</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sequential media managed by robotic libraries or autoloaders.</li>
          <li>Plan for extended seek times and multiple cartridge swaps.</li>
          <li>Control compression settings; log each load/unload event for chain of custody.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="distinction">
        <h2>Categories vs Types: Why the Distinction Matters</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Categories</strong> answer “What kind of persistence and role does this storage have?”  
          <strong>Types</strong> answer “How is this storage exposed to me?”
        </p>
        <p>
          A secondary storage device might present as DAS, NAS, SAN, or a cloud-mounted block. Confusing category with type can lead to wrong acquisition methods—mounting when you should image or scripting APIs against a live filesystem—and may invalidate evidence in court.
        </p>

      <section id="final">
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose the right tools—from RAM grabbers to tape robotics or cloud SDKs.</li>
          <li>Preserve both volatile execution artifacts and long-term archives.</li>
          <li>Document a clear, defensible chain of custody and methodology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Build exercises that walk the same dataset through DAS imaging, NAS exports, SAN LUN captures, and cloud API exports. This hands-on approach cements concepts and readies your workflow for any forensic scenario.
