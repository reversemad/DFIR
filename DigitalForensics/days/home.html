    <h2>Why This Series Exists</h2>
    <p>
      In the world of digital forensics, understanding how a system boots is
      not optional—it’s foundational. Whether you're recovering deleted
      partitions, dissecting bootkits, or tracing malware through EFI binaries,
      your investigation begins at the disk and ends at the bootloader.
    </p>
    <p>
      This series is designed to take you from <strong>basic disk
      architecture</strong> to <strong>advanced boot forensic
      analysis</strong>, with hands-on commands, real-world tools, and
      investigative workflows. It’s not just a technical guide—it’s a forensic
      blueprint.
